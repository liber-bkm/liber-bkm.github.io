description: Use liber on your phone, standalone or connected to a server.

On Android, liber can act as a client for self hosted server or standalone app that saves bookmarks as needed. However on android the archiving of bookmarks doesn't involve javascript's so archiving capabilities are limited to webpages without including any javascript in it. You can also use termux to use desktop version of liber on android if you want full archiving capabilities using single-file or monolith if you want to use liber on android as a server. See [Install on Android](/install/android/) for setup.

## Finding bookmarks

The list shows your whole collection. Type to search; the chips narrow the search to titles, URLs, tags, notes, or folders, Deep also searches saved page content, and the Sort button reorders (newest, oldest, most visited, title). Tapping a bookmark opens its detail page; Open launches the live page in your browser.

Long-press list entries to select several at once, then delete them, set their tags, or move them to a folder together.

## Adding bookmarks

Tap Add, enter the URL (the title is fetched automatically), and optionally tick Markdown notes or a full-page archive. Archives take a while to fetch. Attaching files works too.

The fastest way to save while browsing: use Android's share sheet on a page and send it to liber. The add form opens prefilled. Sharing plain text without a link opens a narrowed search instead.

Adding a URL that is already bookmarked tells you so, with the option to add it anyway.

## Organizing

- **Detail, Edit, Delete**: every bookmark can be retitled, retagged, moved, given notes or an archive after the fact, or deleted (with a confirm step).
- **Tags** lists every tag with counts. Rename merges into an existing tag of that name; delete asks first and tells you how many bookmarks are affected.
- **Folders** works the same way for folders and subfolders. Deleting a folder moves its bookmarks back to the root; the root itself has no actions.
- **Rules** files new bookmarks automatically by URL or title match. The learn section suggests rules from how your collection already clusters, with create-all and apply-all. Editing a rule can reapply it to bookmarks it already classified.
- **Profiles** (from settings) keep fully separate collections, e.g. work and personal. Switching changes the collection everywhere; removing a profile only untracks it, nothing on disk is touched.
- **History** shows what you opened, most recent first.

## Saved pages and health

Detail offers the saved copies when they exist: the card (always kept), the full-page archive, and your notes, all readable offline. Attachments download and open in an external viewer.

Check scans your links and groups them into moved (update the URL, optionally refreshing the title), dead, and uncertain (delete with a confirm step, or quarantine into a folder for later review). See [Link health](/guide/link-health/).

## Library and backup

From settings, Library covers the heavy lifting:

- **Import** a browser bookmark export picked from your files.
- **Share export** sends the whole collection as a portable bookmark file you can keep or move to another device. See [Importing and exporting](/guide/import/).
- **Static site** writes a browsable offline copy into the collection.
- **Sync** commits the collection when it lives in a git/jj repo, with an optional push. See [Syncing across devices](/guide/sync/).
- **Maintenance** (reindex) merges conflict copies and journals, and can prune or compact on a fully synced collection. Prune and compact ask first. See [Reindexing](/config/reindex/).

**Before uninstalling or wiping the phone, export.** The collection lives in app-private storage, which Android deletes with the app. Share an export to somewhere safe first; after reinstalling, import it back. Reimport assigns fresh ids but keeps every URL, title, tag, folder, and description.

The ⋮ menu's sync folder picks a folder that survives reinstalls and can carry the static-site export out of app-private storage.

## Settings

Settings shows the collection location, counts, and health status, plus:

- **Archive backend**: on Android only the built-in native snapshot is available (single-file and monolith need desktop binaries), so leave it on auto. See [Archive backends](/config/archive-backends/).
- **Profiles** and **Library** screens described above.
- **Switch to legacy WebView**: restarts into the web view of the same collection. The ⋮ menu there returns to the native view.

## Info

- The app needs the INTERNET permission only (loopback server, page fetches, archives). Nothing runs when the app is closed.
- Everything is stored privately on the device; settings shows the effective path but the config file itself is managed through the app.
- Rotating the phone never loses your place or restarts anything.
- If something goes wrong, airplane-mode screens show a retry instead of hanging. For a bug report, `adb logcat -s LiberApp` captures the app log.
